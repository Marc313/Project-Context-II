  title: Why solar farms are a bad idea
  content: "During my visit at the solar farm protest, I found out that solar farms
    might not be the best idea. No one is waiting on them and the protesters had
    solid points. A few examples; solar farms are really expensive and when they
    break the waste that left is not biodegradable. On top of that there is no space
    in densely populated areas. Solar panels also depend on the amount of sunlight
    which there is not much of in the winter around here. And lastly they\u2019re
    just an eyesore."

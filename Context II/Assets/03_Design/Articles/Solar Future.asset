  title: Why solar farms are the future
  content: "After my visit to the CEO\u2019s of the solar farms they\u2019re planning
    to place in town, I learned why the solar farm is highly needed. The solar farms
    are a one time investment! After placing the solar panels the maintenance costs
    are very low. They can generate sustainable energy for up to 30-40 years. Solar
    farms also combat climate change. Lastly the solar panels don\u2019t pollute
    the air unlike burning fuels."

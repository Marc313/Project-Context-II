Paper Conflict is a fun, applied game about sustainability and the conflicts that take place around this topic.

In Paper Conflict, two parties are in an escalated conflict, and are throwing arguments at each other. These arguments are visualized as paper wads. The player will start playing with a character that is anti-solar farm. The goal is to hit the other party with as many arguments as possible to convince them to change their opinion.

However, whenever one party is 'winning', the player will switch sides, meaning that the player is now on the 'losing' side. After playing for a while, the player will start to feel that this situation is pointless, and that the conflict is a never-ending cycle. Meanwhile, the environment will start to burn, and after 3 minutes, a final cutscene will play, emphasizing how forcing arguments onto another party without listening to them is pointless and will cause nothing but destruction.
